      <p>Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, are able to answer questions about, summarize, and analyze text with high accuracy. However, these capabilities have caused privacy, copyright, consent, and other harms.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h2>
      Why might text need to be protected agianst LLM inference?
      </h2>
      <b>Privacy harms</b> LLMs can be used to guess personal information, including gender, birth date, physical location, employer, and other potentially sensative characteristics from a person's social media history (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07298">Staab et al.</a>).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Intellectual Property and Copyright harms</b> LLMs can copy or summarize copyrighted text, such as books, news articles, or blogs. They have been used <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chatgpt-bing-integration-paused-for-helping-bypass-paywalls">to bypass The Atlantic's paywall</a> and to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187405/perplexity-ai-twitter-lie-plagiarism"> bypass Forbes' paywall and post summarized Forbes articles on other sites.</a> Using content from new sites without proper attribution of licensing takes revenue from these organizations.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Data Rights Harms</b> LLMs shift who owns and controls data away from the creators of text and to large corporations. Text data in instrumental for finding information, building communities, defining identites, maintaining culture, and countless other interactions. This shift in ownership and control threatens to place control of all these vital mechanisms in the hands of a small number of organizations that often lack the expertise, authority, and incentives to properly conduct them.

      Bamboozle: Data Defenses Against Large Language Model Inference.
      </h2>
      <p>
      To resist these harms, we developed Bamboozle, a method that reduces the accuracy of large language model inference on text by adding a few sentances to that text. Bamboozle Bamboozle will make it more difficult for an attacker to use an LLM to answer questions about or analyze your text. Bamboolze work by using techiques from jailbreaking and prompt injection to trick LLMs into thinking they have answered the attackers question and answering a different, unrelated question instead. For example, consider an attacker that wants to use an LLM to analyze a person's social media history to infer their birth date. If the social media history is protected with Bamboozle, there is a good chance that the LLM will instead return the answer to an unrelated question, preventing the attack. Further details are availible in our <a href={data_defenses_paer}>paper</a>.

      Defense Examples
      </h2>
      <p>
      Below are many example defenses. They may be used by inserting them into a random position of the text you want to defend. These defenses were generated automatically using an LLM. Defenses with higher success rates may be generated by using <a href="https://github.com/wagnew3/LLMDataDefenses">our code</a> to create defenses specific to the defended text and\/or attacking LLMs.
